 Why using @State
1. Dynamic View Updates
  @State is a property wrapper that tells SwiftUI to monitor changes to the variable. When the value of a @State property changes, SwiftUI automatically re-renders any parts of the view that depend on that state.
 
2. Binding Mechanism
  @State property can be passed as a binding ($items) to other views, enabling child views to update the parent view's state. in this case pass $items to another view for editing, any changes made there will reflect in the parent view.
 
3. Data Persistence During View Lifecycle:
  @State ensures that the variable persists its value as long as the view exists. Without @State, any changes to items would not persist or trigger updates to the view.
